title: "Analysis and Detection of malicious activity on
DoH traffic"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-doh
excerpt: 'This paper discusses the systematic approach to
analyze and detect DoH and non-DoH traffic, and further
methods to catch malicious DoH over covert network traffic
conditions. DNS over HTTPS methodology overcomes the vulnerabilities brought about in regular DNS requests and reinforces
the data transmission, but equally important is detection and
prevention on their malicious counterparts using their statistical
characteristics as mentioned in this text. Further, this paper
forms a base on the data features and their relative importance
in determining DoH transfers, enabling possibilities of training
numerous Machine learning and Deep Learning Algorithms.'
